# elisp 

This specific set of configuration files and additions has been used
professionally since 1997, growing and adjusting to different needs
over the years.

Using elpa to add standard elements to emacs has been a nice
convenience but I want to take it a step further. Rather than spending
time configuring things that should just work, I want to mold my
decade old, inherited elisp library to act like an addition to [The
Emacs Starter Kit](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)

## Installation

1. Install the Starter Kit
2. Move the directory containing this file to ~/.emacs.d/$USER
3. Make ~/.emacs.d/$USER.el for user specific configurations
4. Launch Emacs!

(in this addition set, we simply hook into the user-specific-config
defined in the Starter Kit)
